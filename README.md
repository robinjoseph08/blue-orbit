# Blue Orbit

A simple Pebble Time watch face that shows the hours and minutes numerically and
represents the minutes by the position of the small orbiting circle. It also
shows the date underneath the time as well.

## Notes

* I had the color of the background shift between blue, green, and red every
minute, but it wasn't very battery efficient so I removed it.
* The small orbiting circle used to represent the second hand instead of the
minute hand, but that also drained the battery considerably.
