# Blue Orbit

A simple Pebble Time watch face that shows the hours and minutes numerically and
represents the seconds by the position of the small orbiting circle.

## Notes

Originally, I had the color of the background shift between blue, green, and red
every minute, but it wasn't very battery efficient so I removed it.
